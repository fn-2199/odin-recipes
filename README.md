Project: Recipes from TheOdinProject

This is the first project assigned by The Odin Project. It is solely to test my basic HTML skills that I have acquired so far in the HTML section of the Foundation path. This simple webpage demonstrates my ability to create a basic HTML boilerplate from memory, and use proper html tags (along with proper attributes) for heading, image, links, ordered, and unordered list.

05/17/22: Stylized all 4 html documents with css. The 3 recipe files invokes the same style.css file. I wrote the css file in a way that it'll apply to the 3 html files considering they all share the same structure. However, I assigned different background-color values to each pages. Internal CSS method proved to be useful in order to override the default background color declared in the external css file. Some new css properties that I learned and used during this update was object-position, object-fit, text-shadow, and background-size.
