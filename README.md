Project: Recipes from TheOdinProject

This is the first project assigned by The Odin Project. It is solely to test my basic HTML skills that I have acquired so far in the HTML section of the Foundation path. This simple webpage demonstrates my ability to create a basic HTML boilerplate from memory, and use proper html tags (along with proper attributes) for heading, image, links, ordered, and unordered list.
